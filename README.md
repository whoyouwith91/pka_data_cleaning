# pka data processing & cleaning

We cleaned some public pka datasets for ML modeling, which includes ChemBL(calculated), dataWarrior(exp), novartis(exp) and literature(exp). And great thanks to the data and scripts provided in [pkasolver-data](https://github.com/wiederm/pkasolver-data) as the starting point, we prepared a list of jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to process and clean these datasets.   

- On ChemBL dataset
