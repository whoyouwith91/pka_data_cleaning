# pka_data_cleaning

We prepare a list of jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to process and clean the calculated/experimental datasets for ML modeling. The datasets include ChemBL(calculated), dataWarrior(exp), novartis(exp) and literature(exp). And great thanks to the data and scripts provided in (pkasolver-data)[https://github.com/wiederm/pkasolver-data].
